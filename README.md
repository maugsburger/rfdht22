rfdht22
=======

rf temp/hum sensor, based on DHT22 and NRF24L01p, glued together by attiny2313a

possible improvements
---------------------

 - use ATMega 169PA or other with integrated LCD driver to reduce power even more (needs usefull lcd glass like 6x11-segment)
 - optional layouts with/out LCD or other components (dht22 is happy with charge pump)
 - lan interface for master
 - hack some radiator controller to enable remote control
